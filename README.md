## [OOD ~ Object Oriented Dinner](https://ideabile.github.io/ood/)
![Object Oriented Dinner](http://www.craveonline.com/images/stories/2011/2012/March/Comedy/10-nerdy-last-suppers/last-supper-science.jpg)

The scope of this repository is: Make your pull request, with the Objects,
you bring, for dinner.

And if I approve the Pull Request you are invited to dinner at my place.

Since I like to talk about OOP, and I'm a JavaScript programmer.
The language of the menu is JS, with some accent of Backbone.js;
 ~ yes I know we are rude to speak a dialect, instead of a language.

So the next dinner is: <b>18/04/2015<b> at <b>19:30</b>
